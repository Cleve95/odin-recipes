# odin-recipes

As part of my Foundations course on TOP(The Odin Project) I'm going to create my first website.
It's going to be a recipe website, and I'm going to demonstrate my skills learned thus far.
At the moment these include the basics of HTML and GIT / GITHUB, but in the future I will return
and update my website with CSS.
